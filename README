# 163FinalProject

Lily Young - General Helper :)
    I helped UV unwrap and texture the dog model so that it would import properly into Unity. I worked on the (failed) animation, and an initial version of a disco floor using the Game of Life algorithm. 

Sandra Latt - 3D Modeler
    As a 3D modeler, I made the initial model of the dog, disco ball, and sparkle in Blender. I helped with setting up some of the project too.
